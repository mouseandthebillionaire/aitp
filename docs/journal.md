# An Invitation to Document the Process of Making a Soundwalk

Not sure how this is going to function as far as versioning audio projects, but worth a shot to see what happens!

05.22.25 | Camera Ready

Submitted the [camera-ready documentation](../CRD.md) to ICMC today. Have been thinking as I prepared this document how much more daunting it is to come up with this concise snapshot of the idea (pallery text, description) than the actual project itself. The soundwalk, while daunting, feels like the fun work. It's basically a lecture done in experimental audio, which seems much more manageable when I think of it that way. The CRD on the other hand, somehow feels more concrete. More scrutinized. Which falls in the line with the thing I always say about your documentation being the thing that more people will experience than the actual project.

Aaaaanyway. It's too late now, cause it's submitted and it'll just have to be what it is!
