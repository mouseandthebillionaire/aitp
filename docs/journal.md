# An Invitation to Document the Process of Making a Soundwalk

Not sure how this is going to function as far as versioning audio projects, but worth a shot to see what happens!

05.22.25 | Camera Ready

Submitted the [camera-ready documentation](../CRD.md) to ICMC today. Have been thinking as I prepared this document how much more daunting it is to come up with this concise snapshot of the idea (gallery text, description) than the actual project itself. The soundwalk, while daunting, feels like the fun work. It's basically a lecture done in experimental audio, which seems much more manageable when I think of it that way. The CRD on the other hand, somehow feels more concrete. More scrutinized. Which falls in the line with the thing I always say about your documentation being the thing that more people will experience than the actual project.

Aaaaanyway. It's too late now, cause it's submitted and it'll just have to be what it is!

05.22.25 (part 2) | Initial Scouting

In Boston for the next few days to get some dedicated time to think about this project and physically walk around the garden. It's _very_ rainy, which is less than ideal, but it was really nice to see the space again, especially in the context of the things that I want to say.

A few notes/thoughts I had on my first lap around the lake:

* I realize that I want people to go clockwise from the George Washington statue and am reminded that in the ol' Disneyland lore most people go right (being right-handed) when they get to the end of Main Street. This could be a fun thing to talk about as we begin.
* Almost immediately to the left there is a gigantic dawn redwood, which is amazing. Even more amazing, it has a twin directly across the lake. There might be something here to talk about. Time? Community? 
* The "Make Way for Ducklings" statues are even better than I remembered. _Very_ playful. There is an opportunity here to talk about them as an object that invites a playful stance. We could encourage picking out your favorite duckling and a) invent a story about its mood b) mimic its pose c) actually interact with it somehow?
* You can see the carousel in the commons from here (and even better as you round the corner of the lake). Could be used as audio/reference/topic of conversation.
* The Triton Babies fountain is fairly perfect/delightful for this. Two kids literally playing in the water. 
* Going underneath the bridge from here will give us an opportunity to do some fun juxtaposition sound a la Cardiff/Miller's saxophone under the bridge. I will go back later and record five minutes or so of the sound of rain falling around the area. I think that the conversation of "we are in two different times but occupying the same playspace" could be fun.
* The swan boats seem like an obvious win here, but I'm worried it's going to be too crowded. Maybe better to have a fun activity as you go by, but not talk about them until we are safely across the lake.
* There is a stretch right after the swan boats that is very straight and lined with benches. This feels like a great opportunity to talk about "performative play." We can encourage the listener to choose a playful way of walking (skipping, running, strutting, catwalk, backwards) in front of this "audience."
* I didn't get any ideas for much more from here so maybe we can stop at one of the statues on Boylston, or just have a non-localized discussion of play as we walk back towards the bridge, ending across from the swan boats.

Over all (and especially after reading through most of "The Well-Played Game" on the plane ride), I am thinking more and more of this as a true invitation to play. An invitation in which the character "I" am the playmate and am positioning myself as a cohabitant in the space of play. An interesting idea, I think. Perhaps not for the entire walk, but definitely for some portion of it.

05.22.25 (Part 3) | Initial Script Pass

I took a (huge) swing at a first pass of the first part of the script, and it's feeling kind of good actually. The friendly, less-authoritative voice feels good. I did a quick take on the second (going left) section, and uploaded it to the Echoes platform (along with a test of overlapping drone notes to see what the sounds like during the walk) Unfortunately the Echos platform is third party, so we won't be able to see/hear the versions as I go, but I took a screenshot which I think gets us a fairly good idea. (also, for a housekeeping note. I am going to leave all of these screeshots with the auto-generated timestamp format that Apple gives them for better tracibility)

Now off to test!

05.22.25 (Part 4) | Initial Walkthrough

The test went really well. The overlaying of sound zones to create procedural music worked perfectly. I might try to actually record some music today, but it's unfortunate that I don't have my push with me. That would have really made it easy to work on this here (good to know for "next time"!)

I recorded the sound from underneath the bridge. 5 minutes of just the rain and ambient noise, and then I did a version of the "we're in the same space, cohabiting in play together, even though we're across time" conversation. Probably not at all usable, but good to start churning through that dialogue. When I got back to the hotel I worked on that section in the script, so we're making progress there. Just three more sections to go, and hopefully more testing tomorrow!
