## Begin - Let's Play (Invitation)

** note: I want the general feeling of this to be similar to the opening chapter of DeKoven's Well-Played Game, where he is having a 'dialogue' with the reader about the game they are playing together **

Well. Here we are in front of a statue of ol' George Washington. Not really the most playful of people, I'd say, but I mean, maybe he had a good time cutting down that cherry tree during the actual act?

Anyway. I've invited you here to play. There's a lot that comes packaged in that word. Play. You may think about kids playing in the playground. (FX) The subtle heirachies of it, and time-outs, and home bases. Or maybe you're thinking of organized sport. (FX) Of the roar of a crowd when the home team surges ahead  Or maybe [speeding up] Video games (FX) or improvisational jazz (FX) or theatre (FX) or game-shows (FX) or (on and on and on until the sounds pile on and then cut to silence.

But I'm not talking about any of that. I'm talking about a simple attitude of play. A way of looking at the world. When we play, we don't take the world at face value. We bend time, space, objects, and ourselves to these invented rules. We...

But, I'm getting ahead of myself. First, a formal invitation: are you willing to play with me? If so, let's turn to our left towards Beacon Street and take the path around the lake. 

C'mon! Try to keep up!

## Go Left - Dawn Redwood?

We chose to go left, but I suppose we easily could have gone right? Somehow clockwise feels appropriate when we're talking about play. Order of turns and all that. Also I'm left-handed, so I tend to favor the left.

Did you know that at Disneyland, (FX) most people traditionally get to the end of Main Street and turn right at Sleeping Beauty's castle? Because of this, Tomorrowland is usually the most crowded right after the park opens. So, the next time you have a choice, why not go left. Or do something else that surprises you. Play with expectations!

Speaking of going left, look at that tree to our left. The one with the fern-like leaves and knotty truck. That's a dawn redwood (FACTS)

What do you say we head over to those duckling statues up ahead? I'll race you!
